# Extending Vim Syntax Highlighting for Sed

I have added highlighting for the features added to sed as GNU extensions, as these are not included in the default sed.vim.

There are a few other languages I am looking into doing this for, but this sed the only one that is finished so far.

# Installation

Just copy `syntax/sed.vim` into `~/.vim/syntax/sed.vim` and it will replace the existing sed higlighting.
